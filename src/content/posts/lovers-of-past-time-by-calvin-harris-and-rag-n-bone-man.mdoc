In this soulful track, the artists reflect on a deep connection that transcends time. The lyrics evoke patience and yearning, as if waiting for a lifetime for something elusive to happen. Daydreams and signals sent out into the universe create a sense of longing. The chorus reveals that they were “lovers in a past life,” slow dancing in the midnight glow. The familiarity of their bond suggests that perhaps they’re not mere strangers.&nbsp;[Distance only strengthens their hearts, and late at night, they wonder what the other is thinking, even if they’re in someone else’s arms1](https://genius.com/Calvin-harris-and-ragnbone-man-lovers-in-a-past-life-lyrics)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_in_a_Past_Life).

The song’s blend of electronic beats and Rag’n’Bone Man’s unique vocals creates an enchanting atmosphere. Released in February 2024, “Lovers in a Past Life” has resonated with listeners, earning its place as a perfect summer jam.&nbsp;[The artists’ collaboration captures the essence of timeless love, leaving us with a sense of nostalgia and wonder about the mysteries of our shared pasts1](https://genius.com/Calvin-harris-and-ragnbone-man-lovers-in-a-past-life-lyrics)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_in_a_Past_Life).

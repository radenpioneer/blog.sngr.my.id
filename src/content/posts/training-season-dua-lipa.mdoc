In this introspective track, Dua Lipa questions whether someone is worthy of her heart or merely a toxic influence. The lyrics explore the difficulty of distinguishing between love and poison, especially late at night. The singer desires someone who understands her deeply and can hold her close, deeper than she’s ever known. The metaphor of a rodeo emphasizes the wild and unpredictable nature of love.&nbsp;[Ultimately, “training season” is over, and she seeks genuine connection without having to teach someone how to love her right1](https://genius.com/Dua-lipa-training-season-lyrics)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaHHVNN-z0E). 🎶

The song’s chorus reveals Dua Lipa’s newfound clarity about the kind of partner she desires. She yearns for someone who can hold her close, deeper than she’s ever known, and whose love feels like a rodeo—passionate, exhilarating, and unpredictable. This desire stems from her personal growth; she no longer wants to train her partners on how to love her. Instead, she seeks a genuine connection where understanding flows naturally, without the need for explanations.&nbsp;[“Training Season” encapsulates the journey from teaching to finding someone who matches her soul, and it’s a declaration of empowerment and self-assurance in matters of the heart1](https://storyofsong.com/story/training-season/)[2](https://auralcrave.com/en/2024/02/16/dua-lipa-training-season-the-song-lyrics-their-meaning/). 🎶

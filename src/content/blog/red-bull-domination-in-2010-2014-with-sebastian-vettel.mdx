Red Bull Racing and Sebastian Vettel were the dominant force in Formula One from 2010 to 2014, winning four consecutive constructors' and drivers' championships. They achieved this remarkable feat by combining technical excellence, driving skills and mental strength, while their rivals failed to challenge them consistently and effectively.

Red Bull's chief technical officer, Adrian Newey, designed cars that had exceptional aerodynamic performance and downforce, making them the fastest and most reliable on the grid. The Red Bull RB6, RB7, RB8 and RB9 were the cars that Vettel and his teammate Mark Webber drove to victory in those years. Vettel was especially strong in qualifying, setting the fastest time 44 times out of 77 races in 2010-2013. He also won 37 races, including 13 in 2013 alone, and equalled Michael Schumacher's record for most wins in a season. He also matched Juan Manuel Fangio's record for most consecutive world titles with four.

Vettel was a very fast and consistent driver, who could extract the maximum performance from his car and make few mistakes. He was also very good at managing his tyres, which was crucial in the era of high-degradation Pirelli tyres. Vettel was able to adapt his driving style to suit different cars and conditions, and he often found an advantage over his rivals in terms of setup and strategy. Vettel was also a very mentally strong driver, who could cope with pressure and adversity. He showed great determination and resilience in his title fights, especially in 2010 and 2012, when he had to overcome several setbacks and challenges. He also showed great confidence and self-belief in his abilities, which gave him an edge over his opponents. Vettel had a playful and humorous personality, which helped him to relax and enjoy his racing. He also had a habit of giving his cars names, such as "Luscious Liz", "Randy Mandy" or "Suzie".

Red Bull's main rivals in 2010-2014 were Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes, but none of them could match Red Bull's technical excellence and driver performance. Ferrari had a competitive car in 2010 and 2012, but they lacked the speed and reliability of Red Bull. Alonso was the only driver who could challenge Vettel for the title, but he was often let down by his car or his team. Ferrari also made some strategic errors and failed to develop their car as well as Red Bull. McLaren had a fast but fragile car in 2010 and 2012, but they suffered from poor reliability and operational mistakes. They also had a tense and competitive relationship between their drivers, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, which sometimes affected their results. McLaren also failed to adapt to the new regulations in 2013 and 2014, and their car became uncompetitive and unreliable. Mercedes had a slow and inconsistent car in 2010 and 2011, but they improved significantly in 2012 and 2013. They had a strong driver lineup with Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg, who won one race each in 2012. They also had a clever F-duct system that gave them an advantage in qualifying, but they struggled to maintain their pace in the races. Mercedes also had some reliability issues and tyre problems that hampered their performance.

In conclusion, Red Bull's domination in 2010-2014 with Sebastian Vettel was the result of a combination of factors, such as their technical superiority, Vettel's driving skills and mental strength, and their rivals' challenges and failures. Red Bull and Vettel were able to create a winning formula that gave them an edge over the rest of the field, and they achieved remarkable success and records in those years. However, their domination came to an end in 2014, when new regulations and a new rival, Mercedes, changed the balance of power in Formula One.
